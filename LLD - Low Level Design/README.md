# Low Level Design (LLD)

This repository is dedicated to mastering **Low Level Design (LLD)** with a
strong focus on **clean code, object-oriented design, and real-world system thinking**.

LLD bridges the gap between **high-level architecture (HLD)** and **actual code implementation**.
It helps in designing scalable, maintainable, and testable software systems.

## What is Low Level Design?

Low Level Design focuses on:
- Designing **classes, interfaces, and methods**
- Defining **object interactions**
- Applying **SOLID principles**
- Using **design patterns**
- Handling **edge cases and failure scenarios**

In simple terms:
> LLD is the blueprint of code before writing the actual code.

## LLD vs HLD

| Aspect | HLD | LLD |
|------|-----|-----|
| Focus | System architecture | Code structure |
| Level | Modules & services | Classes & methods |
| Answers | What to build | How to build |
| Audience | Architects | Developers |

HLD defines the system.
LLD defines the implementation.

## Why LLD is Important?

- Improves code readability and maintainability
- Reduces bugs and technical debt
- Enables easy feature extension
- Helps in cracking product-based interviews
- Essential for large-scale real-world applications

## Core Concepts Covered

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- SOLID Principles
- UML Diagrams (Class & Sequence)
- Design Patterns
- Exception Handling
- Data Structure Selection
- Real-world problem modeling

## Repository Structure

- `/solid-principles` – In-depth examples of SOLID principles
- `/design-patterns` – Commonly used design patterns
- `/uml-diagrams` – Class and sequence diagrams
- `/problems` – Real-world LLD problems (Parking Lot, ATM, etc.)

## Learning Approach

1. Understand the problem clearly
2. Identify entities and responsibilities
3. Define relationships between objects
4. Apply SOLID principles
5. Introduce suitable design patterns
6. Write clean, extensible Java code

## Tech Stack

- Language: Java
- Concepts: OOP, SOLID, Design Patterns
- Tools: Git, GitHub

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to develop an **architectural mindset**
rather than just writing working code.

This repository is a continuous learning journey towards
becoming a better software engineer and system thinker.
